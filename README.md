# Telegram Birthday Bot
## Features
[*] Register - every other user can follow you and get alerts on your birthday
[*] Follow a non-user - you can locally track your unregistered friends
[*] Alerts - get alerts on your friends' birthdays
[*] Delayed alerts - get alerts before the birthdays to get some time to prepare
[*] Timezones - get alerts in the right timezones of your friends
[*] Groups - if you have a friend group, you don't need to add each member individually. Group members get alerts about every other member
